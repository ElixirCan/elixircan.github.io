**What is a WaffleTalk™?**

Sometimes tech talks and meetups are not done in a way that is accessible to everyone.

In order to keep things approachable we've decided to combine two of our favorite things
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; WAFFLES and ELIXIR &mdash; <br>
for a casual meetup intended to teach you about current topics in software development.

**When are they?**

We were thinking about Saturday mornings, after the best cartoons are done on TV.
<br>But we're open to suggestions. :)

**Who are they for?**

YOU. (unless you don't like waffles.)

**Why?**

We want to grow the Elixir software development community.

**What do they cost?**

We're arranging for sponsorship so that we can provide them for free.
